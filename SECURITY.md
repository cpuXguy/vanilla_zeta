Use this section to tell people about which versions of your project are
currently being supported with security updates.

Future versions will be supported as the project evolves.

## Reporting a Vulnerability

Since this project consists of a single JavaScript function with a simple input and return behavior,
there are no known security concerns at the moment.

However, if you believe youâ€™ve discovered a security issue, please report it through the contact page at WWW.ZETA-CALCULATOR.COM.
You can submit your report via the provided email address.
I will review all reports and address them if necessary.
