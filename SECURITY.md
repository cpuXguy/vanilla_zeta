## Reporting a Vulnerability

Since these projects each consist of a single JavaScript function with simple input and return behavior, there are no known security concerns at the moment.

However, if you believe youâ€™ve discovered a security issue, please report it through the contact page at WWW.ZETA-CALCULATOR.COM.
You can submit your report via the provided email address.
I will review all reports and address them if necessary.
